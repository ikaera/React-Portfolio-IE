## Description

<!-- Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn? -->

### User Story

- AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications,
  - I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples,
    - SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

<!-- What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running. -->

### Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
  - WHEN I load the portfolio
    - THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
  - WHEN I view the header
    - THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
  - WHEN I view the navigation titles
    - THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
  - WHEN I click on a navigation title
    - THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
  - WHEN I load the portfolio the first time
    - THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default
  - WHEN I am presented with the About Me section
    - THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
  - WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section
    - THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories
  - WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
    - THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
  - WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
    - THEN I receive a notification that this field is required;
  - WHEN I enter text into the email address field
    - THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address;
  - WHEN I am presented with the Resume section
    - THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies;
  - WHEN I view the footer,
    - THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter).

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ``` -->

- ## The URL of the functional, deployed application:
- ## The URL of the GitHub repository, with a unique name and a README that describes the project:

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

🏆 The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/lernantino/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here. -->

<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
